- CMF - Drupal
- My JS expertise is represented by AngularJS
- I can work on front-end with the help of CSS, LESS, Bootstrap, jQuery
- As my development tool I mainly use GIT

I like working with clients and I like to be fully dedicated to the projects. However, I also train newer developers and can work as a team-lead.


##################### PHP & Python Web Developer ###################

Hello, Clients.

I develop projects of varying complexity in PHP (10 years) and Python (5 years).

And good experience with technology stack: Ruby, C#, Java (android), Mysql, Postgresql, AWS API, Openstack API, WMware API, EmguCV, ZeroMQ, ZhGuery.

I specialize in the automation of business processes of enterprises (CRM / ERP systems) and neural networks (education - applied mathematics).

I have worked a lot on corporate (enterprise) projects, where tasks are much more complex than ordinary projects.

I am interested in tasks of any complexity, the most interesting is the backend development in PHP and Python, but the frontend, especially in JQuery, is also relevant.

The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. -Nelson Mandela

🙂 Have a nice day!
