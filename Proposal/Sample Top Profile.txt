Welcome to my profile!

I do web development, I use NodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend. My code is written using TypeScript, and I set up transpilation and bundling to whichever environment I need it to go. I have built a framework for my web development projects which combines the best technologies I have found after years of research and experience. I continue to study and improve both my skills and my codebase to make each project better than the previous one. Now I am moving towards a new field, blockchain development, and I am carefully picking the technologies I will be investing my time to study and work with.

### MY FAVORITE TECHNOLOGIES ###

Languages
TypeScript

Frontend
React

Backend
NodeJS, Express, FeathersJS

Bundler
Microbundle, Vite

Package manager
PNPM

Databases
MySQL, PostgreSQL, FaunaDB, MongoDB

Cloud
Firebase, Heroku

Mobile
PWAs

Blockchain
Cardano, Marlowe

Runtime type library
Zod


### MY MAIN PROJECTS ###

FullStack TypeScript first framework - Asas Virtuais

I‚Äôve created my own full stack solution for web development, which
combines the best technologies for web development that I‚Äôve
encountered throughout my career (FeathersJS, Zod and React).


Subscription based apps - Why web dev. is my speciality

Both during my job and on side hustles I have created subscription based
apps. On these apps I built a monolithic server that integrates multiple
services through their APIs (mainly Stripe and Airtable). All these projects
included authentication, authorization, implementation of business logic
and data modeling. Each project helped me improve from the previous.


Working with blockchain - Cardano and Marlowe

In recent years I‚Äôve given a few days every month to participate and learn
about blockchain technologies. From this study I‚Äôve concluded that
Cardano is the right blockchain for me to invest my time and skills on.
After a while of activity in the Cardano community I have decided that
Marlowe should be my focus and I started to actively study and build
around it.
