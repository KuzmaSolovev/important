I work full-time as an Operations Manager to make processes more efficient. I've helped eliminate countless spreadsheets, merged data from multiple systems into a structure I helped design & build, written custom report pages, set up automatically triggered notifications, scheduled report deliveries, and much more.

I love what I do. It's very rewarding to be able to say "Yes, of course we can make that better!" and also be able to deliver on that promise quickly.

Using a low-maintenance database platform called Quick Base, I'm able to do this in a matter of weeks rather than months. Additionally, I would be more than happy to train a member of your staff on how to maintain & make updates to the database--no programming knowledge required, just a computer savvy employee will do the trick!
