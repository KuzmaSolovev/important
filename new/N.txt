Hi
I am a react expert. Most of work has been done with React.js and React Native(frontend) and node.js, Django(backend),ExpressJs, next.js.

I have quite a good experience with Reactjs. Understanding all the logic and the lifecycle of React makes me comfortable in developing applications in Reactjs.

Besides, I have a good understanding of Javascript ES6 features(Airbnb js style) which is mostly used on React and I wanted to let you know I'm capable of handling any React code because I have from experience and intensive study acquired a deeper insight and understanding of how React works under the hood.

I can confidently say that I have a great understanding in many of React's advanced and newest features, including the recently introduced state management system called Hooks ,and React-Redux,Redux Saga, GraphQL, React-hooks, styled-components, Reactstrap.

To conclude, I believe I am the right person for the job and I will gladly take any quizes or challenges you might have to prove myself as deserving enough to take this project.

Here are some websites I made..
