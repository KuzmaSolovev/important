Deliver checklist:
Checklist
1.Unit Test should cover all the logic branches
2.Run unit test at local
3.If there are lint in the repo, make sure it passes linting, I.e. npm run lint
4.Clean unused log and code comment
5.If use the useful log, please use the context log tool
6.Remove access token or other sensitive data info
7.Before and at end of your work, always rebase on the latest {rebase_branch} to task branch, I.e. git fetch –all && git rebase origin/ {rebase_branch}, never do git merge origin/{rebase_branch} , ask for what’s {rebase_branch} for different project. develop is the base branch from upkeep
8.For node/react project, pls check in packages.json if there is lint cmd, if so make sure it pass lint, otherwise fix it (usually add --fix), and then you commit
9.For git flow (either in remote desktop or your own computer), you need commit, and when close to delivery, you need push, but make sure your changes are less than 5 commits, you can either do git commit –amend for each commit, or you can do squash in the end of your work.
10.For adding new env variable, adding it to all env config including production (helmchart, or in config file), when value is not known, add placeholder: REPLACEME, we don’t expect a separate ticket to add a prod env variable.
11.For golang project, don’t commit: vendor and go.mod, go.sum
12.when there is no unit test/integration test that can verify your deliverable, send screenshoot of the testing evidence
